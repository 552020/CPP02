Yes, the term "ad-hoc" in ad-hoc polymorphism essentially means "for this specific purpose" or "as the situation requires." It highlights how this form of polymorphism is designed to handle specific cases of function or operator usage with different types or numbers of arguments. Let's delve into the distinction between ad-hoc polymorphism and subtype (runtime) polymorphism to clarify why one is considered "ad-hoc" compared to the other.

### Ad-hoc Polymorphism

- **Specificity**: Ad-hoc polymorphism is specific in the sense that it directly addresses the need to use the same function or operator name for different types of operations, distinguished by the arguments' types and/or number. This form of polymorphism is resolved at compile time, with the compiler selecting the appropriate function or operator overload based on the arguments' compile-time types.
- **Flexibility for Specific Cases**: It provides flexibility by allowing the programmer to define multiple versions of the same function or operator, each tailored for specific argument types. This makes it particularly useful for functions or operations that conceptually perform the same action (like addition, subtraction, comparison, etc.) but need to work with different types of data.

### Subtype Polymorphism (Runtime Polymorphism)

- **General Applicability and Inheritance**: Subtype polymorphism, on the other hand, is based on the general principle of object-oriented programming that allows an object of a subclass to be treated as an object of its superclass. This form of polymorphism is resolved at runtime, which means the system decides which method to invoke based on the actual object's type during execution.
- **Inflexibility in Changing Types**: The "cannot be changed" aspect you mentioned can be interpreted as the inheritance hierarchy being fixed once defined. You cannot, at runtime, change the fact that an object of a subclass is also an object of its superclass. However, you can override methods in subclasses to provide specific implementations, which is how subtype polymorphism introduces flexibility.

### Comparing the Two

- **Resolution Time**: Ad-hoc polymorphism is resolved at compile-time, making it "ad-hoc" in the sense that specific function/operator versions are chosen based on the static types of arguments. Subtype polymorphism is resolved at runtime, with decisions made based on the dynamic type of objects.
- **Purpose and Use**: Ad-hoc polymorphism is more about providing specific implementations for operations that have the same name but work with different types or numbers of inputs. Subtype polymorphism is about leveraging an inheritance hierarchy to allow different types of objects to be used interchangeably through a common interface (superclass), with the specific behavior determined by the object's actual type at runtime.

In essence, "ad-hoc" versus "cannot be changed" (in the context of subtype polymorphism) reflects the difference in how these polymorphism types are designed to address specific programming needs: ad-hoc polymorphism by providing tailored implementations for different cases at compile time, and subtype polymorphism by allowing a flexible, interchangeable use of objects through inheritance and method overriding at runtime.
