Fixed-point and floating-point numbers each have their unique advantages, depending on the specific requirements of the application. Here are the main advantages of fixed-point numbers compared to floating-point numbers:

1. **Simplicity**: Fixed-point arithmetic is simpler and more straightforward to implement in hardware. This simplicity can lead to lower power consumption and cost, which is particularly advantageous in embedded systems or applications where resources are limited.

2. **Performance**: For certain applications, especially those that do not require a large dynamic range or very high precision, fixed-point operations can be faster than floating-point operations. This is because fixed-point arithmetic can often be executed directly by the processor's integer unit without the overhead of floating-point units.

3. **Predictability**: Fixed-point arithmetic has deterministic execution time, making it easier to predict how long operations will take. This predictability is crucial in real-time systems, where meeting timing constraints is often more important than the precision of the calculations.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: Implementing fixed-point arithmetic requires less silicon real estate than floating-point arithmetic. This can result in cheaper and more energy-efficient processors, which is particularly beneficial for mass-produced devices.

5. **Precision Control**: With fixed-point numbers, the programmer has explicit control over the placement of the decimal point, which can be an advantage in applications where the precision and scale of the numbers are known and fixed. This control allows for optimization of the arithmetic to the specific needs of the application.

6. **Lower Power Consumption**: Because of their simplicity and efficiency, fixed-point operations typically consume less power than floating-point operations. This makes fixed-point arithmetic preferable for battery-powered devices or applications where energy efficiency is a priority.

7. **Stability in Certain Calculations**: In some specific mathematical operations, fixed-point arithmetic can offer better numerical stability than floating-point. This is because the quantization errors in fixed-point arithmetic are predictable and uniform, which can be advantageous in tightly controlled algorithms.

Despite these advantages, it's important to note that fixed-point arithmetic is not universally better than floating-point arithmetic. The choice between fixed-point and floating-point representations depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the need for precision, range, performance, and resource constraints. Floating-point numbers offer a much wider dynamic range and are easier to use for general-purpose computing, especially when dealing with very large or very small numbers.
